> Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. – Steve Jobs

I was never too close to my father. He practically spent his whole life working from 6AM to 8PM everyday and the only time that I could see him was on Sundays. And even then, he wanted to rest to get ready for the next week. Therefore, our relationship was not as close it should be, since he could not be present. This was true till a few years ago when he got unemployed. He started spending a lot of time at home, but I was already 18 years old and the attention that I needed was far less than when I was a child.

Eventually he started working again, but his job required a lot of effort from him. When he arrived home everyday he coughed a lot, but since he had been a smoker for a long time and this was usual, there was nothing to fear. Things got worse overtime and he decided to go to the hospital where he had a CT scan. At that time I got a little confused about him having a CT scan, instead of a regular X-Ray, but I didn't question myself too much. Some days passed till the day when I arrived from school and my mother told me he was heavily ill.

> Cancer. Lung cancer. The most aggressive of all.

After hearing that, instead of crying or yelling, I remained calm and cold as ice. Stupid that I was, I've only asked: "When is he going to start the treatments?". In spite of all the coldness, this was the only way of telling myself that he could survive. That he could fight and defeat another obstacle - probably the most difficult of all. And most deadly.

> When you come to the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on. – Franklin D. Roosevelt

At the beginning, no one would tell his illness since it was not clear by just looking at him. He soon started his treatments and, after many attempts, the cancer finally shrank. Light at the end of the tunnel - for a moment. In spite of knowing he had cancer, there was nothing that could hold him back from fighting. But, more than the disease, he was worried about something else. My sister was pregnant at that time and the feeling of doubt of not seeing his grandson born was killing him. But after 9 months, my nephew and godson was born - and my father was alive. There were absolutely no words to describe his enthusiasm and, at the same time, his relief. 

> His eyes were shining again because of that beautiful baby boy.

For some months, he felt the joy of being a grandfather. But those days were short and, unfortunately, there was more to come.

> When you think things cannot get any worse, well, they can. 

On October he started to have a lot of pain around this back and, after 3 unsuccessful visits to the hospital, he finally had a MRI. **Another punch in the chest**. His cancer was already spread to his bones and pancreas. Worse than that, the treatments were not being effective enough to shrink it again. This was when doctors lost control of the situation. 

After reaching this point, he began to lose hope as he started to lose his strength. 

> His pain was more than he could bear. But he went every single day to pick up his grandson.

In spite of being prohibited to drive, he didn't care about that for a single moment. He could only walk using crutches, but his effort and will were way stronger than his limitations. He wanted to feel useful and be able to actually live his own life. A couple of months passed till December.

> We had finally spent Christmas as a whole family. But he deeply knew it was the last.

In contrast to previous years, he was happier than ever. His grandson filled the room on that night. Both looked like children and it was wonderful to watch. At that moment, I couldn't stop to think how more a person can ask than love and family. And after seeing that, since the first day, I was optimist of his recovery in spite of his serious health state.

> However, despite my optimism, a moment that I never saw coming changed everything. 

On a January night I went to his bedroom to give him a good night kiss and the TV was on. But, despite that fact, he was watching nothing at all. Instead, he was deeply inside his thoughts, his eyes were black and the room was freezing. When I got close and looked at him, time stopped for a couple of seconds.

> His face of defeat broke my soul apart.

At that moment, I knew it - there was no turning back. He said nothing. No good night, nothing. And quite frankly, there was nothing to say. This happened three days before he passed away.

Beyond the suffering, his incapability and the seriousness of the disease, I kept watching him fighting for the little light at the end of the tunnel and, in truth, that was quite a relief for me, because I felt his hope and courage would save him. Unfortunately, I was wrong all along.

The week before he died, the only thing moving was not his legs, but his will to live - nothing more. What he cared the most was his grandson and the inevitability of not seeing him grow. Not play with him. Not live with him. Not being capable of holding him again. Not hearing of his voice. Not calling his name. Nothing actually.

> But in spite of being too young right now, one day he will read this.

And he will understand how **important** he was to you. And the lessons we take from this - specially, those which matter the most. 

> And for him, you mattered the most Henrique.
